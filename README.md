# TicTacToe

TicTacToeV1 - { multiple improvements throughout the build process, starting off with human vs human }

PrototypeCPU - { then implementing a simple 'machine learning' system for human vs CPU }

TTTvCPU - { Ended up scrapping the prototype algorithm, going for a simpler method. Weighing then organising the patterns by weight, picking the max, and cycleing through the corresponding patter }
