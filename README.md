# TicTacToe

TicTacToeV1 - Multiple improvements throughout the build process, starting off with human vs human.

PrototypeCPU - Implementing a simple 'machine learning' system for human vs CPU.

TTTvCPU - Ended up scrapping the prototype algorithm, going for what feels like a sleeker or more elegant method. Weighing then organising the patterns by weight, picking the max, and cycleing through the corresponding pattern.

I dont know what I'm doing.
